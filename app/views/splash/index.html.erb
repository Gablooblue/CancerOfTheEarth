	    <p>This project was created to highlight the injustices we have caused
		and address the rising issue which is literally killing us and the animals around us.</p>
	    <p>In this website, we will show you the various effects of climate change on our Mother Earth.
		This includes details which help you realize just how bad the problem is. By showing you 
		these, we hope to be able to make you emphatize with the problem and help motivate you to 
		fight against this problem.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Our objective is to bring light to the current situation that our country is facing and 
		help motivate you to try to do something about it.

			  This fish, also called Butanding here in the Philippines, is also endangered but not endemic here in the Philippines.
			  It travels from Leyte, to Batangas to Indonesia, Madagascar, Mozambique, to the South Atlantic Ocean, to the Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia.
			  These whale sharks are big but rely on filter feeding, meaning the little creatures called plankton with the addition of some fish eggs.
			  These sharks have become endangered because of its fins, skins, and oils, another effect of human activity.

			  This fish is called tawilis.
			  You may know it as a staple food at home but did you know it is one of the endemic fish found in the Taal lake.
			  These fish travel in groups, and dwell near the surface where their food (plankton) is. 
			  Since these fish eat plankton these are filter feeders.
			  These fish reproduce when the temperature of the water is the highest during April to July.
			  Filipinos overfish tawilis as the demand grows larger, and this caused these species of fish to be endangered.

		      <p>
			  These giant clams are a popular food ingredient in the south east asian cuisine. 
			  These clams are filter feeders as well, but also rely on algae as a source of nutrition. 
			  These clams are hermaphrodites, and release their eggs and sperms to the water to nearby clams. 
			  These clams are also sold in the black market for decorative purposes.
			  It is also known that some ingredients here trigger increased levels of sex hormones and possibly may be harvested for that purpose as well.

            <h4>Sewage</h4>
	    <p>Chemical pollutants in sewage eventually find their way into the ocean.
		The release of other chemical nutrients into the ocean’s ecosystem leads to reductions in oxygen levels, 
		the decay of plant life, a severe decline in the quality of the sea water itself. As a result, 
		all levels of oceanic life, plants and animals, are highly affected.

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 mx-auto">
            <h4>Toxic Chemicals from Industries</h4>
	    <p>
		Industrial and agricultural waste are another most common form of wastes that are directly discharged into the oceans,
		resulting in ocean pollution. The dumping of toxic liquids in the ocean directly affects the marine life as they are considered hazardous and secondly,
		they raise the temperature of the ocean, known as thermal pollution, as the temperature of these liquids is quite high. 
		Animals and plants that cannot survive at higher temperatures eventually perish.
	    </p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 mx-auto">
            <h4>Land Runoff</h4>
	    <p>
		Land runoff is another source of pollution in the ocean. This occurs when water infiltrates the soil to its maximum extent and the excess water from rain,
		flooding or melting flows over the land and into the ocean. Often times, this water picks up man-made, harmful contaminants that pollute the ocean,
		including fertilizers, petroleum, pesticides and other forms of soil contaminants.
		Fertilizers and waste from land animals and humans can be a huge detriment to the ocean by creating dead zones.
	    </p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 mx-auto">
            <h4>Large Scale Oil Spills</h4>
	    <p>
		Ship pollution is a huge source of ocean pollution, the most devastating effect of which is oil spills.
		Crude oil lasts for years in the sea and is extremely toxic to marine life, often suffocating marine animals to death once it entraps them.
		Crude oil is also extremely difficult to clean up, unfortunately meaning that when it is split; it is usually there to stay.
